# Architecture baseline

## Product boundary

Hearth is **local-first + P2P-first + end-to-end encrypted + cloud-assisted**. “P2P-first” means direct QUIC is the preferred delivery path; it does not promise that offline recipients can be reached without encrypted store-and-forward.

## Trust boundaries

| Component | Responsibility | May contain plaintext? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Desktop client | identity, encryption, local history, UI | Yes, locally |
| SQLite | authoritative local persistence | Yes, locally |
| Direct/relay transport | encrypted envelope delivery | No |
| Control plane | discovery, signaling, device metadata | No message plaintext |
| Object mailbox | short-lived encrypted bundles/files | No |

The first implementation intentionally exposes no connectivity, encryption, or delivery claims. It only persists the local onboarding profile.

## Dependency direction

`desktop → app-core → database` and `desktop → protocol`.

The protocol crate owns versioned, transport-neutral envelopes. The database crate owns schema and SQL. The app-core crate owns user-facing state transitions. Networking, identity/crypto, synchronization, groups, files, and calls will be separate crates so they cannot leak transport or storage concerns upward.

## Protocol rule

Every packet uses a numeric version, immutable UUID, sender device ID, conversation ID, monotonic sequence, type, timestamp, and **ciphertext**. Envelope validation rejects unsupported versions and empty ciphertext. Encryption/session implementation will be introduced only after a reviewed protocol choice is made.

## Persistence rule

SQLite uses WAL and foreign keys. Migrations create the initial `profiles`, `conversations`, `messages`, and `pending_outbound` tables. `messages.ciphertext` is the sole message payload field. Queued work is explicit in `pending_outbound`; UI must distinguish local persistence, sending, delivered, and read.

## Future integration seams

1. Identity keys and secure OS key storage.
2. Iroh endpoint and connection state machine (direct, relay, offline).
3. Authenticated DM session and outbound queue worker.
4. Cloudflare discovery/signaling plus encrypted mailbox.
5. Friends, MLS groups, file transfer, then media.
